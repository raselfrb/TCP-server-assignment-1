# TCP python server / client
> TCP communication through python, sending recieving files, using user logins.
Currently the program is able to:
* Register new user
* Check if username is taken
* Check if username and password is correct
* Send files with the extension of .jpg and .txt

## Setup
The code for this can be found in the two TCPPython folders, Server
and client has to be ran in two different CLIs or IDEs

## TODO:
* fix various crashes
* create function for removing users from the serverside (with admin account login perhaps)
